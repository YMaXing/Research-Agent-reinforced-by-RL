# Lesson 4: Structured Outputs

In our previous lessons, we laid the groundwork for AI Engineering. We explored the AI agent landscape, looked at the difference between rule-based LLM workflows and autonomous AI agents, and covered context engineering: the art of feeding the right information to an LLM. In this lesson, we will tackle a fundamental challenge: getting structured and reliable information *out* of an LLM.

LLMs operate in a world of unstructured data and probabilities, where we input instructions in plain English and get results as plain text. This subdomain of engineering is often called "Software 3.0". Our application, however, relies on deterministic code and predictable data structures, which is known as "Software 1.0". Structured outputs are the bridge between these two worlds, a fundamental technique for forcing LLMs to return consistent, machine-readable data. Mastering this is essential for any AI engineer building production-grade systems.

## Understanding why structured outputs are critical

Before we start coding, it is crucial to understand why structured outputs are foundational to building reliable AI applications. When an LLM returns a free-form string, you face the messy task of parsing it. This often involves fragile regular expressions or string-splitting logic. These methods easily break if the model changes its phrasing even slightly [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11751965/), [[2]](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.21585v1). Structured outputs solve this by forcing the model’s response into a predictable format like JSON.

This approach offers several key benefits. First, structured outputs are easy to parse, manipulate, and debug. Instead of wrestling with raw text, you work with clean Python objects like dictionaries or, even better, Pydantic models. This allows you to programmatically access the data you need without guesswork, making your code cleaner and more predictable.

Second, using libraries like Pydantic adds a layer of data and type validation [[3]](https://www.speakeasy.com/blog/pydantic-vs-dataclasses), [[4]](https://codetain.com/blog/validators-approach-in-python-pydantic-vs-dataclasses/). If the LLM returns a string where an integer is expected, your application will not crash silently with a `TypeError` or `KeyError` down the line. Instead, it will raise a clear validation error immediately. This "fail-fast" behavior is essential for building reliable systems and preventing bad data from propagating through your application.

Structured outputs create a formal contract between the LLM and your application code, making it easier to pass data around the system. Engineers use this pattern everywhere. As seen in Image 1, we leverage structured outputs to pass the right subset of information to the next LLM step or other downstream systems like databases, user interfaces, or APIs. For example, a popular use case is to extract properties like names, tags, and dates to build knowledge graphs for advanced RAG or natural language filters to filter records from the database [[5]](https://www.prompts.ai/en/blog-details/automating-knowledge-graphs-with-llm-outputs), [[6]](https://humanloop.com/blog/structured-outputs).

To understand how structured outputs work in practice, we will explore three ways to implement them: from scratch with JSON, from scratch with Pydantic, and natively with the Gemini API.

## Implementing structured outputs from scratch using JSON

To understand what happens behind the scenes in modern LLM APIs, we will first implement structured outputs from scratch by prompting a model to return a JSON object. This will help you build an intuition for the underlying mechanics. Our goal is to extract key details like a summary, tags, and keywords from a financial document and parse the output into a Python dictionary.

1. First, we set up our environment by defining the Gemini client and the model we will use. For this example, we will use `gemini-1.5-flash`, which is fast and cost-effective for simple tasks.
    ```python
    from utils import env
    import json
    from google import genai
    
    env.load(required_env_vars=["GOOGLE_API_KEY"])
    client = genai.Client()
    MODEL_ID = "gemini-1.5-flash"
    ```

2. Next, we define a sample document for the model to analyze.
    ```python
    DOCUMENT = """
    # Q3 2023 Financial Performance Analysis

    The Q3 earnings report shows a 20% increase in revenue and a 15% growth in user engagement, 
    beating market expectations. These impressive results reflect our successful product strategy 
    and strong market positioning.

    Our core business segments demonstrated remarkable resilience, with digital services leading 
    the growth at 25% year-over-year. The expansion into new markets has proven particularly 
    successful, contributing to 30% of the total revenue increase.

    Customer acquisition costs decreased by 10% while retention rates improved to 92%, 
    marking our best performance to date. These metrics, combined with our healthy cash flow 
    position, provide a strong foundation for continued growth into Q4 and beyond.
    """
    ```

3. We craft a prompt that instructs the LLM to extract metadata and format it as JSON. We provide a clear example of the desired structure and use XML tags like `<document>` and `<json>` to separate the input data from the formatting instructions. This is a common and effective prompt engineering technique for improving clarity and guiding the model’s output [[7]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-the-openai-api), [[8]](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/structured-data-response-with-amazon-bedrock-prompt-engineering-and-tool-use/).
    ```python
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze the following document and extract metadata from it. 
    The output must be a single, valid JSON object with the following structure:
    <json>
    {{ 
        "summary": "A concise summary of the article.", 
        "tags": ["list", "of", "relevant", "tags"], 
        "keywords": ["list", "of", "key", "concepts"],
        "quarter": "Q...",
        "growth_rate": "...%",
    }}
    </json>

    Here is the document:
    <document>
    {DOCUMENT}
    </document>
    """
    ```

4. We send the prompt to the model and inspect the raw response. As expected, the model returns a JSON object, but it is often wrapped in Markdown code blocks.
    ```python
    response = client.models.generate_content(model=MODEL_ID, contents=prompt)
    ```
    It outputs:
    ```text
    ```json
    {
        "summary": "The Q3 2023 financial report highlights a strong performance with a 20% increase in revenue and 15% growth in user engagement, surpassing market expectations. This success is attributed to a robust product strategy, effective market positioning, and successful expansion into new markets, leading to improved customer retention and reduced acquisition costs.",
        "tags": [
            "financials",
            "earnings report",
            "business performance",
            "revenue growth",
            "market expansion",
            "Q3 2023"
        ],
        "keywords": [
            "Q3 2023",
            "revenue",
            "user engagement",
            "market expectations",
            "product strategy",
            "market positioning",
            "digital services",
            "new markets",
            "customer acquisition costs",
            "retention rates",
            "cash flow"
        ],
        "quarter": "Q3 2023",
        "growth_rate": "20%"
    }
    ```
    ```

5. To handle this, we create a helper function to strip the Markdown tags, leaving a clean JSON string that can be safely parsed.
    ```python
    def extract_json_from_response(response: str) -> dict:
        """
        Extracts JSON from a response string that is wrapped in <json> or ```json tags.
        """
    
        response = response.replace("<json>", "").replace("</json>", "")
        response = response.replace("```json", "").replace("```", "")
    
        return json.loads(response)
    ```
    While simple string replacement works for clean outputs, a more robust solution would use regular expressions to find the JSON block and include error handling for malformed data. For example, you could wrap the `json.loads` call in a `try...except` block to catch `JSONDecodeError` and handle cases where the LLM fails to produce valid JSON [[17]](https://machinelearningmastery.com/the-complete-guide-to-using-pydantic-for-validating-llm-outputs).

6. Finally, we parse the string into a Python dictionary, which can now be used in our application.
    ```python
    parsed_response = extract_json_from_response(response.text)
    ```
    It outputs:
    ```text
    {
      "summary": "The Q3 2023 financial report highlights a strong performance with a 20% increase in revenue and 15% growth in user engagement, surpassing market expectations. This success is attributed to a robust product strategy, effective market positioning, and successful expansion into new markets, leading to improved customer retention and reduced acquisition costs.",
      "tags": [
        "financials",
        "earnings report",
        "business performance",
        "revenue growth",
        "market expansion",
        "Q3 2023"
      ],
      "keywords": [
        "Q3 2023",
        "revenue",
        "user engagement",
        "market expectations",
        "product strategy",
        "market positioning",
        "digital services",
        "new markets",
        "customer acquisition costs",
        "retention rates",
        "cash flow"
      ],
      "quarter": "Q3 2023",
      "growth_rate": "20%"
    }
    ```
This manual method works, but it relies on post-processing and lacks data validation. If the LLM makes a mistake, like outputting a string instead of an integer or missing a key, our application will fail. Next, we will see how Pydantic provides a much more robust solution.

## Implementing structured outputs from scratch using Pydantic

Forcing JSON output is an improvement, but it still leaves you with a plain Python dictionary. You cannot be sure what is inside it, whether the keys are correct, or if the values have the right type. This uncertainty can lead to bugs and make your code difficult to maintain.

Pydantic solves this problem. It is a data validation library that enforces structure and type hints at runtime, ensuring data integrity from the moment it enters your application [[3]](https://www.speakeasy.com/blog/pydantic-vs-dataclasses). It provides a single, clear definition for your data structure and can automatically generate a JSON Schema from your Python class. When an LLM produces output that does not match your Pydantic model, the library raises a `ValidationError` that clearly explains what went wrong. This "fail-fast" behavior is essential for building reliable systems, preventing bad data from moving through your application and causing hard-to-debug errors later.

1. We define our desired data structure as a Pydantic class. This class acts as a single source of truth for your output format. It works with Python's standard `typing` library, but since Python 3.9, you can use built-in types like `list` directly. For example, `tags: list[str]` is now preferred over importing `List` from `typing`. It is also a best practice to add clear descriptions for each field, which helps both developers and the LLM understand their purpose [[18]](https://zenvanriel.com/ai-engineer-blog/pydantic-ai-validation).
    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
    
    class DocumentMetadata(BaseModel):
        """A class to hold structured metadata for a document."""
    
        summary: str = Field(description="A concise, 1-2 sentence summary of the document.")
        tags: list[str] = Field(description="A list of 3-5 high-level tags relevant to the document.")
        keywords: list[str] = Field(description="A list of specific keywords or concepts mentioned.")
        quarter: str = Field(description="The quarter of the financial year described in the document (e.g, Q3 2023).")
        growth_rate: str = Field(description="The growth rate of the company described in the document (e.g, 10%).")
    ```
    You can also nest Pydantic models to represent more complex, hierarchical data. This allows you to define intricate relationships between different pieces of information. However, it is good practice to keep schemas as simple as possible, as deeply nested structures can confuse the LLM and lead to syntax or structural errors [[19]](https://dev.to/klement_gunndu/stop-parsing-json-by-hand-structured-llm-outputs-with-pydantic-1pg0). Here is an example:
    ```python
    class Summary(BaseModel):
        text: str
        sentiment: float

    class Tag(BaseModel):
        label: str
        relevance: float

    class ComplexDocumentMetadata(BaseModel):
        summary: Summary
        tags: list[Tag]
    ```

2. With our Pydantic model defined, we can automatically generate a JSON Schema from it. A schema is the standard for defining the structure and constraints of your data, acting as a formal contract between your application and the LLM. This contract dictates the expected fields, their types, and any validation rules. This is similar to the technique used internally by APIs like Gemini and OpenAI to enforce a specific output format [[9]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output). This enforcement often relies on grammar-based decoding, which constrains the model's token generation to ensure the output is syntactically correct and adheres to the schema [[20]](https://tetrate.io/learn/ai/llm-output-parsing-structured-generation).
    ```python
    schema = DocumentMetadata.model_json_schema()
    ```
    The generated schema is detailed and includes descriptions from the `Field` definitions to guide the generation process.
    ```text
    {'description': 'A class to hold structured metadata for a document.',
     'properties': {'summary': {'description': 'A concise, 1-2 sentence summary of the document.',
       'title': 'Summary',
       'type': 'string'},
      'tags': {'description': 'A list of 3-5 high-level tags relevant to the document.',
       'items': {'type': 'string'},
       'title': 'Tags',
       'type': 'array'},
      'keywords': {'description': 'A list of specific keywords or concepts mentioned.',
       'items': {'type': 'string'},
       'title': 'Keywords',
       'type': 'array'},
      'quarter': {'description': 'The quarter of the financial year described in the document (e.g, Q3 2023).',
       'title': 'Quarter',
       'type': 'string'},
      'growth_rate': {'description': 'The growth rate of the company described in the document (e.g, 10%).',
       'title': 'Growth Rate',
       'type': 'string'}},
     'required': ['summary', 'tags', 'keywords', 'quarter', 'growth_rate'],
     'title': 'DocumentMetadata',
     'type': 'object'}
    ```

3. We update our prompt to include this JSON Schema, giving the model a much more precise set of instructions.
    ```python
    prompt = f"""
    Please analyze the following document and extract metadata from it. 
    The output must be a single, valid JSON object that conforms to the following JSON Schema:
    <json>
    {json.dumps(schema, indent=2)}
    </json>

    Here is the document:
    <document>
    {DOCUMENT}
    </document>
    """
    ```

4. We call the model and extract the JSON string as before.
    ```python
    response = client.models.generate_content(model=MODEL_ID, contents=prompt)
    parsed_response = extract_json_from_response(response.text)
    ```
    It outputs:
    ```text
    {
      "summary": "The Q3 2023 earnings report indicates strong financial performance with a 20% increase in revenue and 15% growth in user engagement, driven by successful product strategy, market expansion, and improved customer retention.",
      "tags": [
        "Financial Performance",
        "Earnings Report",
        "Business Growth",
        "Market Expansion",
        "Customer Metrics"
      ],
      "keywords": [
        "Q3 2023",
        "revenue increase",
        "user engagement",
        "digital services",
        "new markets",
        "customer acquisition costs",
        "retention rates",
        "cash flow"
      ],
      "quarter": "Q3 2023",
      "growth_rate": "20%"
    }
    ```

5. Now, the biggest difference is that we can load the output dictionary into our Pydantic model and validate it. A more advanced pattern for handling validation errors is to implement a retry loop. If validation fails, you can automatically send a new request to the LLM, including the validation error message in the prompt to guide the model toward a correct response [[17]](https://machinelearningmastery.com/the-complete-guide-to-using-pydantic-for-validating-llm-outputs).
    ```python
    try:
        document_metadata = DocumentMetadata.model_validate(parsed_response)
        print("\nValidation successful!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\nValidation failed: {e}")
    ```
    It outputs:
    ```text
    Validation successful!
    ```
    The `document_metadata` Pydantic object can now be safely used throughout your application. This is the main advantage: you move from unclear dictionaries to clean, predictable Python objects.

While Python’s built-in `dataclasses` or `TypedDict` can define structure, they only provide type hints for static analysis and do not perform runtime validation [[3]](https://www.speakeasy.com/blog/pydantic-vs-dataclasses), [[4]](https://codetain.com/blog/validators-approach-in-python-pydantic-vs-dataclasses/). If the LLM returns a string where an integer is expected, these tools will not catch the error. Pydantic’s runtime validation, type constraints, and clear schema definitions make it our favorite way for structuring and validating our domain data structures.

## Implementing structured outputs using Gemini and Pydantic

While Pydantic brings structure and validation, we still had to construct the prompts and handle responses manually. When working with modern APIs such as Gemini and OpenAI, the recommended way to generate structured outputs is by using their native features. This approach is simpler, more accurate, and often more cost-effective than manual prompt engineering, as the vendor will always handle the optimization on top of their models better than your manual prompting [[9]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output), [[10]](https://www.vellum.ai/blog/when-should-i-use-function-calling-structured-outputs-or-json-mode), [[11]](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/AI-ML/Structured-Output-in-vertexAI-BatchPredictionJob/m-p/866640).

Let’s see how to achieve the same result using the Gemini API’s native capabilities. The process becomes much simpler.

1. We define a `GenerateContentConfig` object, instructing the Gemini API to set the `response_mime_type` to `"application/json"` and the `response_schema` to our `DocumentMetadata` Pydantic model. This configures the model to output JSON that is then automatically converted to the given Pydantic model. This is often done through grammar-based decoding, where the API restricts the model to only generate tokens that conform to the provided schema, offering a mathematical guarantee of a valid output structure [[20]](https://tetrate.io/learn/ai/llm-output-parsing-structured-generation).
    ```python
    from google.genai import types
    
    config = types.GenerateContentConfig(response_mime_type="application/json", response_schema=DocumentMetadata)
    ```

2. This configuration makes our prompt significantly shorter and cleaner, eliminating the need to manually inject any type of schema. We simply ask the model to perform the task, as the output format is guided directly by the config.
    ```python
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze the following document and extract its metadata.
    
    Here is the document:
    <document>
    {DOCUMENT}
    </document>
    """
    ```

3. Now, we call the model, passing our simplified prompt and the new configuration object. The API handles the rest, ensuring the output adheres to the schema.
    ```python
    response = client.models.generate_content(model=MODEL_ID, contents=prompt, generation_config=config)
    ```

4. The Gemini client automatically parses the output for us. By accessing the `response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].function_call` attribute, we receive a ready-to-use instance of our `DocumentMetadata` Pydantic model.
    ```python
    document_metadata = types.to_pydantic_model(response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].function_call)
    print(f"Type of the response: `{type(document_metadata)}`")
    ```
    It outputs:
    ```text
    Type of the response: `<class '__main__.DocumentMetadata'>`
    ```
This native approach is robust, efficient, and requires less code.

## Structured Outputs Are Everywhere

Structured outputs are a fundamental pattern in AI engineering, connecting the probabilistic nature of LLMs with the deterministic world of software. Whether you are building a simple summarization workflow or a complex research agent, you will use structured outputs to ensure reliability and control.

This pattern will be a recurring theme throughout this course. In our next lesson, we will explore the basic ingredients of LLM workflows, where we will see how structured data flows between different components. Later, when we build agents that can take action or reason about the world, structured outputs will be how they parse information and decide what to do next. Mastering this technique is a key step toward building powerful and predictable AI systems.
